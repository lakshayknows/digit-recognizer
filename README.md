# Digit Recognizer using Deep Learning

## Description
This project implements a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used is similar to the MNIST dataset, consisting of grayscale images of digits (0-9). The model is trained to classify these digits with high accuracy.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`digit-recognizer-using-deep-learning.ipynb`).
3. The notebook loads the dataset, preprocesses the images, and trains a deep learning model for classification.
4. Evaluate the model's accuracy and visualize predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, typically 28x28 pixels in size. It is preprocessed and used to train a neural network.

## Results
The model achieves a high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits. Training performance and accuracy graphs are included in the notebook.
